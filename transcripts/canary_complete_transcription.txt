Hey everybody I'm Shinobi from Bitcoin Magazine sitting down with Jamison Lop from Casa do you guys drop the hodl officially we're still trying to get the casa x handle without the hodhl maybe someday uh yeah so to start I guess uh just wanted to pick Jamison's brain about a new type of address poisoning attack uh to get their hands on your bitcoin even though you to get their hands on your bitcoin even though you won't see it until after he presents officially at the conference shortly he talked about it here first so I guess uh you you want to just kind of break down the high level of that yeah sure so in January um actually saw a post from Modonot who pointed out a transactional mempool space block explorer transaction on MinPool space block explorer that basically looked like an address poisoning attack and what does that actually mean well it means that someone is sending a small amount of dust you know 500 to a thousand satoshis from an address that they generated in Vanity generated that has the same starting and ending characters as the target address that they're sending it to. And why are they doing this? Well effectively they're hoping to trick the target recipient to send money to their address rather than to the actual uh you know target recipients address. And how would this happen? It would basically require them to be using wallet software that made it really easy for them to go back in their transaction history and accidentally copy and paste the wrong address and as you can imagine this is is a speculative kind of social engineering attack so you have to expect the vast majority of these attacks will fail but you know if you're only spending a thousand sat per try then you could probably get away with a pretty low success rate if for example you trick someone into sending you several Bitcoin yeah it's kind of just like pepper it around and you know see what comes back like it's not like generating the address or dusting it's costing anything really practical so pay very close attention to the address that you enter in the send to field when you make a transaction yeah I mean there's several very easy ways you can prevent this from ever happening first don't reuse Bitcoin addresses that's a very easy one second don't copy paste addresses from your transaction history so um you know some services and tools and stuff offer You know some services and tools and stuff offer address white listing that would be another way to get around doing this to make sure that you're not shooting yourself in the foot Let's dive into the sticky fun topic so uh no surprise in this space but the uh topic of conversations and uh what the next soft work is gonna be is a highly contentious recontentious um you know what do you think in terms of just the general conversational dynamic is a practical way to try at least to move forward with things because it seems to me like everybody is just in a Mexican standoff with completely different priorities completely different analysis of like trade-offs between different proposals like nobody can really agree on anything so like where where do we go from here yeah I think part of the problem right now is that there's too many proposals and they're spread too thin and um and there's a lot of overlap between some of the proposals so I think it would behoove some of those uh soft fork proponents who are interested in getting a proposal implemented that has overlap with functionality of other proposals to try to consolidate um and of course this is gonna require I think people to some people to give up on what they're doing and kind of put their support behind another thing but that's mainly I think why we don't really have enough velocity for any one given thing right now um I myself I would be fine with seeing multiple proposals go through it's um It's actually kind of funny to me because I remember sitting in the room at Hong Kong in 2017 I think when Peter Wolla was announcing how we were actually improving the soft forging process actually improving the soft forking process so that we could have dozens of soft fork proposals in flight at any given time and of course here we are um eight years later and it's hard enough just to have a single proposal in flight yeah kind of like uh how tapscript uh had all these nice unassigned opcodes to fill with things that I aren't getting told so part of the kind of contention that I see at least is a kind of completely contradictory motivations from different parties like some people putting forward proposals are trying to think very conservative and incremental like here are a few an incremental like here are a few basic primitives to work with that are very constrained they only do like the the single thing they're designed to do and are kind of trying to push forward with that incremental attitude whereas a lot of the response to that that I'm seeing the the core of the criticism is that like these incremental improvements aren't really doing enough and so why should we spend the time and the coordination effort and all the development resources to actually push a fork through for something that's just a tiny incremental change and so like these are just two completely different philosophies of how to approach this like we should wait until we actually have something that massively improves functionality versus the step-by-step increment functionality versus the the step-by-step incrementalism and I'm not really sure how those two philosophies can kind of reconcile they're completely like polar opposed yeah I mean the idea of having an incredibly small change is that theoretically it should be in a better position to make it through the Bitcoin in a better position to make it through the Bitcoin Improvement Proposal gauntlet because it should be easier to review it shouldbe simpler to you know understand from an adversarial perspective of how it might be abused uh you know how itmight cause harm in some way if it's used for unanticipated things uh whereas you know the more generic anticipated things whereas you know the more generic stuff just has a much broader potential attack surface and is just much more complicated to think through what could potentially go wrong but the flip side of that is that as should be very obvious now it's an incredibly long and arduous process to get anything through so maybe it is better to have a through so maybe it is better to have a broader proposal where you know you could add like ten different major pieces of functionality in one fell swoop rather than adding one every few years and us being here you know decades later still trying to get some other basic functionality added yeah I think you know part of the broader kind of issue I think you know part of the broader kind of issue uh I d I kind of think of this in layers like if we're discussing the development scope of things like people actually working on the protocol contributing like that has its own problems here in terms of different attitudes like different philosophies to approach things from in the first place but then we also have the the wider problem of But then we also have the wider problem of the ecosystem beyond. Like eventually, if we can address all these issues and get developers on the same page, whatever that is to move forward, there's still the necessity to approach and kind of sell the entire rest of the ecology or something. But right now you have this very ill-educated I would say ill educated I would say attitude that Bitcoin doesn't need to be improved that our victory is guaranteed no matter what we do and so why even bother kind of having these conversations or moving towards this in the first place so like how how do we address that problem if we can get past the first level of conflict between developers first level of conflict between developers. You know I think a lot of this um complexity and difficulty to understand you know who are the stakeholders who need to be in the room you know having these conversations can also be difficult because I suspect you know the vast majority of Bitcoin holders first of all don't actually participate in any So first of all don't actually participate in anything not even social media stuff you know most most people that are into Bitcoin they've just got their Bitcoin and they're living their life Then there's the broad set of people who are into it and they'll do it deep enough so that it is like it's a part of their personality It's a portion of their social network, and so they talk about it you know social network and so they talk about it all the time and um you know these people may buy into any number of different narratives uh i would say unfortunately some of the more broadly adopted narratives tend to be the simpler and more naive ones the things that are really catchy you know the like you know bitcoin is inevitable type of the like you know Bitcoin is inevitable type of stuff which um I I wrote about a bit in uh my breakdown of you knowBitcoin maximalism a few years ago like how we've gotten to that point of essentially each new cohort that comes into the space generally is brought in by a new set of narratives from the previous cohort by a new set of narratives from the previous cohort so you know you could argue that uh you know Michael Saylor and the sort of corporate adoption of Bitcoin is one of the strongest narratives that's happening right now and and these people are by all accounts the the noobies in the Bitcoin space and so they've come at it from a different perspective and they bring their own ideas and their own catch phrases and and then those things and their own catch phrases and and then those things kind of matriculate throughout the ecosystem and the world and then eventually bring in the next cohort uh and and I think that this is true of really any mainstream adoption of anything is that you know the early adopters are the really sophisticated nerdy or more ideological folks and then as they improve And as they improve the technology or good or service or whatever that brings in another cohort that's less sophisticated and they come in because it's more user friendly and they can understand it and that cycle continues to repeat so then you eventually have to ask yourself like are we going to get to a sort of idiocracy level mainstream adoption and it very well may be inevitable And it very well may be inevitable and do the later cohorts of people who aren't as nuanced in their opinions or may not have the same set of ideals or interests How much does their opinion matter right? And so I think a lot of that Then can explain why you know, there was this really long report that came out. I thinka few months ago There was this really long report that came out I think a few months ago that was trying to explain the governance of Bitcoin and who all the stakeholders are. Oh, um, the 1A, uh, 1Z development funding report? I think so. And so that was interesting. Um, you know, I think that you can mostly dumb it down to, uh if you look at what happened in the fork wars, it's the, youknow, the economics happened in the Four Quarters it's the you know the economic power is really what matters if you're talking about consensus changes and so then you have to ask yourself well if the vast majority of economic power as actually shifting into the hands of a few like large corporations and institutions how is that going to change the governance and the future evolution of the protocol It very well may be evolution of the protocol it very well may be that those institutions don't want to see any changes because they don't really care about any of the cypherpunk aspects and the the individual sovereignty of bitcoin holders and trying to scale that sovereignty out to the entire world yeah i mean this is something i think is kind of at the heart of this dynamic and it really kinda And it really kind of frustrates and scares me a little bit to see how many developers either seem to not care about this dynamic or seem to even just dismiss that that this is an empirically observable dynamic occurring right now because the that transition to larger corporate powers and you know service providers as the economically dominant actor on the network I see that as a massive existential risk to Bitcoin because it is their natural incentive to simply monetize shortcomings of things into services and when you're talking about an open protocol like Bitcoin whose whole purpose was to be this open Bitcoin whose whole purpose was to be this open access decentralized censorship resistant network there if you want the economic benefits of the asset and that use of Bitcoin in that way doesn't scale like this naturally creates an incentive for rent seeking and just capture because if they become the economic dominant actor they spin up all these services to monetize the shortcomings and the failings of the protocol what incentive would they ever have in the world to adopt any type of change that that would alter that like that disrupts their ability to just sit back comfortably and rent seek on these shortcomings and really what you've described to a T is what has What you've described to a T is what happened with SMTP with the email protocol and um and that can be difficult to talk about as well because I think if you ask the average person are you an email user they'll say oh yeah you know I use email all the time Well actually you don't yep you're using a trusted third party who then uses SMTP on your behalf and there who then uses SMTP on your behalf and they are a gatekeeper of really a number of layers of meta protocols that are enforced at more of a social layer between the dozen or so gatekeepers that control like 95 percent of all email traffic Yeah it's impossible to essentially spin up your own SMTP server right now it'll be blacklisted and ignored by any major domain so like that that network effect like it is modded off like anybody who wants to to do that 95% of the people using email are behind these few service providers that refuse to accept messages from lesser known services just as a denial of service protection and then you you can't even join And then you you can't even join this network anymore. Yeah and I think that people don't realize how easily that could happen to Bitcoin You know if you have a handful of corporations that are the custodians and a handful của corporations that arе the miners and If most of them are in America And the American government which is actually getting really interested And the American government which is actually getting really interested in Bitcoin right now decides that it's in their best interest to sort of push the finger on the scale it's it's not hard I mean corporations have to comply with the governments that are in charge of whatever jurisdiction that they operate out of yep I mean especially a public company there is just absolutely no legal recourse like I mean at least with a private company like they are capable of internally making decisions that entail taking on risks of the government analyzing them or punishing them but that's just not possible in the structure of a publiccompany and every company in this space that isn't already And every company in this space that isn't already public is eyeballing their path to going public Yeah and I mean this is something that I thought about when I was starting CASA You know we are a legal entity uh you know we have attorneys and even though we're not a regulated financial entity We pay attorneys a lot of money to try to navigate through a very gray area of the legal code and it's always you know certainly before the most recent uh administration it was always possible that the hammer was going to come down and you know the government can force us to do pretty much whatever they want and so from CASA's perspective our main safeguard is that even if the government um you know put a gun to our heads you know we can't take our clients put a gun to our heads you know we can't take our clients money because we simply don't have the keys mm-hmm yeah it's yeah I feel like we've kind of actually I feel Like the trajectory We just took in this conversation is actually that perfect Trajectory for unfamiliar people to really think through these issues and how they relate like the internal development process The wider ecosystem and the risk of capture them the wider ecosystem and the risk of capture there but it's like this to me kind of lays out an environment where we have a a gun to our head and a ticking clock like that this is not a situation where we can just sit back and calmly observe and analyze things to act whenever we we feel like getting around to it like there is a there is а deadline even if it is Like that there is a there is an deadline even if it is ambiguous and not clearly defined we are asymptotically approaching a point where this dynamic of corporate capture will come. And if we do not improve things at the protocol level to the point where we can keep building structures that tend more to a decentralized form versus just falling into the versus just falling into these pressures of centralization like there's there is no way to fix that like we need the key building blocks to accomplish that before we get to that point or there's no way To wind it back yeah and this is why I Started a self custody company, even though it's not the best business model. You know though it's not the best business model uh you know running a custody company is the best way to make money in this phase generally but I felt like we're fighting against human nature and if we didn't put a lot of resources into trying to make self-custody more user-friendly then the inevitable outcome is that almost everybody goes to a third-party custodian and you know that creates everybody goes to a third party custodian and you know that creates systemic risk within the system and weaknesses that we've been talking about here and and really the open question right now is are we doing enough uh it's no it doesn't seem to be going in the right direction and another thing that um I have a big problem with is that a lot of people on social media is that a lot of people on social media keep posting these charts about how the amount of Bitcoin held at exchanges is going down and that metric is terribly flawed by design the way the metric works it always looks like it's going down but then the metric gets updated in hindsight and if you go back and look at it from like a year or two um in the past after it's been updated you see actually no the number didn't go after it's been updated you see actually no the number didn't go down might have actually gone up um just due to the nature of how chain analysis and trying to understand ownership of addresses works yeah I mean you know especially like you have like so much institutional buying pressure these days there's there's no way to kind of really know like something left at custodian's control like if you have a lot of these institutions Like if you have a lot of these institutions who are moving their funds into segregated accounts at these custodians like coming out of the general pool of the hot wallet and what's actually in their order books like that looks like it's leaving the exchange but it's really just going to a different address of the custodian. We kind of have a large work ahead of us this year if we actually want the thing year if we actually want the things that make Bitcoin important and valuable to us to to remain well you know the most that we can do is continue to propose improvements and then the the real question is whether or not ultimately the game theory of Bitcoin plays out in our favor or you know it's it may be a uh a problem of just human coordination um yeah and I've been talking about ossification for a long time like we all understand that as networks grow the coordination problem eventually becomes intractable to the point that no one can agree on anything and so point that no one can agree on anything and so you know a lot of of us who have been around for a while now are basically asking are we already past that point you know we won't really know for sure until we have sufficient hindsight but I think I think actually Jeremy Rubin just posted a few minutes ago how between the the past several major soft forks there was like 1390 days between forks and we did we just passed 190 days between forks and we just passed 1390-days I think since the taproot fork and we don't even have a real proposal on the table for activation. Yep you know despite the uh sailor-driven mantra on Twitter like this is not guaranteed and it's definitely not going to be easy but if anybody out there actually cares about this staying a son out there actually cares about this staying a censorship resistant network that anybody can access like we need to do something to move forward but yes I think caring is actually the the main point um I think I've said for a long time when people have asked me what is the greatest long-term risk to Bitcoin I say apathy if we do nothing um yeah Bitcoin keep do nothing um yeah Bitcoin keeps moving on and you know blocks keep coming through uh but the rest of the world doesn't ossify the rest của the world is going to continue changing and and other entities throughout the world like nation states are going to start exerting pressure and poking and seeing you know what control can they have over this network to their own advantage? That's I think the perfect way to say it you know the the internal game theory of the network is in a way a result of its technical architecture and how that interacts with the real world and so as the real-world evolves and changes if we want to maintain that same game-theoretic equilibrium point like same game theoretic equilibrium point like Bitcoin itself also has to change and step with the world around it or like that equilibrium is just going to shift because the other part of the equation changed even though Bitcoin stayed the same. Bitcoin is far from perfect uh there are there's a ton of room of improvement for security privacy scalability and I don't think that we should rest upon our laurels and say oh we've done so well to this point um and success is guaranteed mm-hmm yeah if anything success is going to be harder to achieve the bigger this gets well yes um now it's been a fun conversation you have any uh depressing conversation and depressing conversation they aren't necessarily mutually exclusive but um did you have any parting words of wisdom this for the viewers uh well like I said uh care participate interact with people continue educating yourself don't just blindly repeat mantras and expect that that is going to somehow be helpful for Bitcoin's long-term health I don't think full for a bitcoin's long term health. I don't think there is a better word you could have left us with thanks for sitting down James on do you bet
