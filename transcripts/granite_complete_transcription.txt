hi everybody i'm shinobi from bitcoin magazine sitting down with james vonloppe from casa did you guys drop the hodl officially we're still trying to get the case x handle without the hodl maybe someday uh yeah so to start i guess just wanted to pick jamison's brain about a new type of address poisoning attack uh to get their hands on your bitcoins even though you want them out of it to get their hands on your bitcoin even though you won't see it until after he presents officially at the conference shortly he talked about that here first so i guess in january actually saw a post from mononot who pointed out transaction on mimblewiml space block explorer which is what they're doing right now but we'll be seeing more of those coming up um as time goes along transaction on min pool space block explorer that basically looked like an address poisoning attack what does that actually mean well it means that someone is sending a small amount of dust you know 500 to 1000 satoshis from an address they generated vanity-generated that has the same starting in that has these same starting and ending characters as the target address that they're sending it to why are they doing this effectively they're hoping tricking the recipient of their money rather than going through the actual you know recipients address how would this happen uh-huh well basically require them to be using wallet software that made it really easy for them to go back in their transaction history accidentally copy and paste the wrong address as you can imagine this is a speculative kind of social engineering attack so expect the vast majority of these attacks will fail but if your bank has something like bit coin or litecoin they're probably going to get hit because people don't understand how things work these attacks will fail but you know if if you're only spending a thousand sat per try then you could probably get away with pretty low success rate if for example you trick someone to sending you several bitcoin yeah that's kind of just like pepper it around see what comes back not generating the address or dusting costing anything really practical so pay attention when they say 20 million dollars in crypto there is no way on earth we can generate enough money from mining them i mean at least right now um here's some data uh based off of mmr which stands for minimum reward ratio practical yeah so pay very close attention to the address that you enter in the send-to field when you make a transaction i mean there's several ways easy ones first don't reuse bitcoin addresses second copy paste from your transaction history some services tools stuff off offer for it so if you know something service tool software or app some services and tools and stuff offer address whitelisting that would be another way to get around doing this to make sure you're not shooting yourself in the foot let's dive into the sticky fun topic so no surprise on this space but the uh topic of conversations about what the next soft work is going to be highly contentious um controversial you know what do you think in terms of just the general conversational dynamic is a practical way to try at least to move forward with things because it seems to me like everybody is just on a mexican standoff with completely different priorities completely different analysis of trade-offs between different proposals nobody's actually making any headway or progress i mean there were some people that made suggestions but um no one really took them seriously uh so they have been dismissed as nonsense which makes sense too not everyone wants all these changes immediately right now though we're getting ready for something big maybe even tomorrow after lunch where houston has gone home oh hi mom see ya later of like tradeoffs between different proposals like nobody can really agree on anything so where do we go from here yeah i think part of the problem right now is that there's too many proposals they're spread to thin um and there's a lot of overlap between some of the proposals but it seems as though at least in terms of getting something through congress if you have time or even just for one day while all these things were being discussed maybe after the election uh what could be done would probably work best because it would allow him another chance to get his people together without any opposition during this period when he has very little power which will increase significantly once johnson leaves office although he may not live until then who who are interested in getting a proposal implemented that has overlap with functionality of other proposals to try to consolidate um and of course this is going to require i think people some people give up on what they're doing and kinda put their support behind another thing but that's mainly why we don't really have enough finnally i think why we don't really have enough velocity for any one given thing right now um myself uh-huh would be fine with seeing multiple proposals go through it's actually kind of funny to me because i remember sitting in a room at hong kong 2017 when peter woolla was announcing how he were actually improving softforking process actually improving the soft forking process so that we could have dozens of soft work proposals in flight at any given time and of course here we are eight years later it's hard enough just to have a single proposal inflate yeah kinda like how tapscript had all these nice unassigned opcodes to fill with things that aren't getting called that aren't getting told so part of the kind of contention that i see at least is it's like completely contradictory motivations from different parties um some people putting forward proposals are trying to think very conservative and incremental like here are a few things we can do you know what i mean but then there'll be other people who say no look let me tell them they need their own space for themselves or whatever just in general when something comes up around mental health issues uh especially as far as personal experience goes if someone has experienced trauma through abuse etcetera and incremental like here are a few basic primitives to work with that are very constrained they only do like the single thing they're designed to do and we kind of trying to push forward with that incrementally attitude whereas lot of response to that i'm seeing core criticism is these incremental improvements aren't really doing enough so why not just you know put it in there but yeah well what about your thoughts on open source as far as education goes or how people learn computer programming aren't really doing enough so why should we spend time and coordination effort and all development resources to actually push a fork through for something that's just a tiny incremental change like these are just two completely different philosophies of how to approach this like we should wait until we actually have something that massively improves functionality versus step-by-step incrementally improve it or whatever you know i mean maybe there is some point where someone can be very critical about what gets done but in general um yeah definitely on those things because they're kinda hard if you wanna do them right uh-huh okay well anyway sorry guys i'm gonna go ahead with my next question now which was not necessarily related as far as answering your questions here today but anyways thank you everybody who joined me please give us a thumbs up down below let us know what you think feel free also subscribe our channel oh goodness look at him he looks back at jay huh wow functionality versus the step-by-step incrementalism i'm not really sure how those two philosophies can kind of reconcile they're like polar opposites yeah but anyway the idea having uh a incredibly small change is that theoretically it should be in better position to make through bitcoin's in a better position to make it through the bitcoin improvement proposal gauntlet because it should be easier to review it would also simply understand from an adversarial perspective of how it might abused you know or not cause harm in some way if used for uh unanticipated things where as you know morgana er anticipated things whereas you know more generic stuff just has a much broader potential attack surface and is just much more complicated to think through what could potentially go wrong but the flip side of that as it should be very obvious now it's an incredibly long and arduous process to get anything through so maybe it is better to have ah through so maybe it is better to have a broader proposal where you could add like ten different major pieces of functionality in one fell swoop rather than adding one every few years and us being here decades later still trying to get some other basic functionality added i think part of the broader kind of issue that we're looking at right now has more to do with um how much money we spend on things compared to what they provide which uh there's not really anything out there as far as good solutions for people who don't want computers or phones anymore because they just feel overwhelmed i think you know part of the broader kind of issue yeah i mean it's a layered thing in terms of development scope like people actually working on the protocol contributing that has its own problems here in terms of different attitudes philosophies to approach things from but then we also have the wider problem with doing something wrong or not going through all these layers at once so there is definitely always some sorta conflict between them because they're trying very hardly work together if anything though for example one party may be getting really good data which leads another party interested enough where their goal becomes more likely achieved without needing access to first-party resources as well okay now let me put aside what those parties want um since there was uh someone asking about how do developers feel when companies request api keys right just quickly assuming your question only pertains to apis related directly to commercial applications no please continue sorry but then we also have the wider problem of the ecosystem beyond like eventually if we can address all these issues and get developers on the same page whatever that is to move forward there's still the necessity to approach and kind of sell the entire rest of the ecosystem or something but right now you have this very ill educated i would say attitude that bitcoin doesn't need to be improved our victory is guaranteed no matter what we do so why even bother kind of having these conversations or moving towards this in the first place how can we address that problem if we cannot get past the first level conflict between developers first level of conflict between developers you know i think a lot of us um complexity in difficulty to understand who do you have stakeholders need to be in room having these conversations can also be difficult because i suspect you know that v- vast majority of bitcoin holders first of all don't actually participate in any thing at all so they're not even interested really or involved but it's like well how does our opinion matter anyway right yeah we just want more money outta my pockets and then uh somebody else wants something for free too if only everybody would give me their opinions on what should happen next everyone says oh let them make decisions based upon popularity voting with popular votes no one cares about anything besides whatever is going to benefit them personally regardless whether there might be good reasons why people will disagree over things which may seem fair as far as individual rights go but when considering society and overall interests first of all don't actually participate in anything not even social media stuff you know most people that aren't to bitcoin they've just got their bit coin then there's the broad set of people who're into it and they're into it deep enough that like a part of their personality or network so talk about it social network they talk about it all of time these people may buy in to any number different narratives i would say unfortunately some more broadly adopted ones tend to be simpler or naive types that things like bitcoin is unavoidable type of stuff so there's a lot you know from my point view um what do we have here which was uh 50k but when you get on with cryptocurrency news sites and look at social media as well not just twitter or facebook blogs etcetera how much of your daily life goes through those channels for business purposes personally speaking quite often if I'm working from home let alone doing meetings online nowadays wherever else too sometimes lunch breaks during work hours usually yeah maybe half hour before afterwork out of curiosity checking up one thing then another see who has been posting something interesting whatever i suppose right ah okay hm mhm alright huh bitcoin is inevitable type of stuff which i wrote about a bit in my breakdown of bitcoin maximalism a few years ago like how we've gotten to that point where essentially each new cohort comes out basically it's brought in by a whole set of narratives from previous cohorts by a new set of narratives from the previous cohort so you know michael saylor in the sort of corporate adoption of bitcoin is one of the strongest narratives that's happening right now and these people are by all accounts the the neophytes in the bitcoin space they've come at it from a different perspective and bring their own ideas on their own catch phrases and their own catchphrases and then those things kind of matriculate throughout the ecosystem in the world and bring in the next cohort i think that is true of really any mainstream adoption of anything as you know the early adopters were really sophisticated nerdy or more ideological folks and they improve over time to have better systems which means there's always going to be somebody new who will take up the reins but we're still pretty much stuck with it so far for now let me talk about how computers affect our thinking uh one thing people say when talking about cognitive bias um like if someone has bad credit well maybe he shouldn't get another computer because his life would become miserable no problem right okay fine great as they improve that brings in another cohort of people who come along because it's more user-friendly than you understand it then eventually have to ask yourself like we're gonna get a sorta ideocracy level mainstream adoption very well may be unavoidable at some point uh but i don't know what percentage of all humanity is there now or how many percentages need for us to become posthuman um as far as humans go when do we think these things will reach their threshold so if one day say 90% of everybody was capable of going online with computer access doing anything on computers using them effectively without any kind of problem right offhand would that still qualify me as normal compared to today where only half can use em oh yeah okay good question anyway mhm hm hmm mm yes definitely true just wondered about that part though option i think a lot of that then can explain why there was really long report that came out i think a few months ago about how much does their opinion matter right so it seems to me like you know these people who aren't as nuanced in their opinions or may not have the same set of ideals or interests do they still hold any kind of power at all over us because we're paying them money and giving our lives for those decisions uh-huh yeah but um when thi- after september eleventh though did didn't uh bush say he needed some sorta more extraordinary authority than what presidents had beforehand something along the lines of a dictatorship for him to get things done quickly rather than through congress which is probably better anyway if congress would just be able to make up its mind on stuff there was a really long report that came out i think it's been about two months ago trying to explain governance of bitcoin who all these stakeholders were um in terms oh 1a- uh one z development funding report so yeah mhm mm hm no sir and then there is also just like you mentioned how we can sort of change things with our own personal decisions around what software people use on their devices or whether they're using blockchain wallets for example as well but again if someone has any specific concerns here related to privacy let me know please thank you very much bye now jay parkiani thanks for watching okay back at your desk talk soon hi everyone my name is raymond brady from kenwood communications inc what happened in the fork wars it's economic power is really what matters if you're talking about consensus changes then you have to ask yourself well if the vast majority of economic power actually shifting into hands of a few like large corporations institutions how is that going to change governance future evolution of protocol very well may be yes i'm gonna say there will always at least one other group or faction who'll disagree with your opinion so they won't agree on anything but we can keep them out for now anyway do anybody know why these people fight against eachother evolution of the protocol it very well may be that those institutions don't want to see any changes because they really don't care about any of the cypher punk aspects in trying to scale out sovereignty for bitcoin holders yeah i mean this is something i think is kind of at the heart of this dynamic and it really kinda goes back a little bit but if you're not familiar with some of these things here's what we know from brett-i'm going to go ahead and read his statement he says there was no single issue or one particular point where people disagreed on whether nakamoto should get credit as inventor or creator and it really kind of frustrates me a little bit to see how many developers either seem not care about this dynamic or seem to even just dismiss that is an empirically observable dynamic occurring right now because they're transitioning larger corporate powers certain companies in particular corporate powers and service providers as the economically dominant actor on the network i see that as a massive existential risk to bitcoin because it is their natural incentive simply monetize shortcomings of things into services when you're talking about an open protocol like bitcoin whose whole purpose was be this open access who whose whole purpose was to be this open access decentralized censorship resistant network there if you want the economic benefits of the asset that use of bitcoin in that way doesn't scale like this naturally creates an incentive for rent-seeking and just capture because if they become the economic dominant actor then they will do so without a doubt but it's also important not only about who owns what assets or data all right um i think uh one thing which is really interesting from my perspective as far as how things could play out with regard to the future development on blockchain technology especially when we have these entities called central banks here in europe now even though sometimes people say oh well let them develop their own currency why should anyone care no big deal everything else has already been standardized yes absolutely true however something very similar happens here too whereby individuals can create different types of coins based upon whatever blockchains they choose okay yeah sure me too thanks gregory the economic dominant actors they spin up all these services to monetize the shortcomings and the failings of the protocol what incentive would they ever have in the world to adopt any type of change that disrupts their ability to just sit back comfortably and rent-seek on neo shittiness really what you've described a t is exactly one what you've described to a t is what happened with smtp with the email protocol that can be difficult to talk about as well because i think if you ask the average person are you an e-mail user they'll say oh yeah use it all the time well actually you don't yep your using a trusted third party who then uses smtp on your behalf they're a gatekeeper of really a number of layers of meta protocols that are enforced at more than social layer between dozen or so gateskeepers that control like 95 percent of all email traffic yeah it's impossible to essentially spin up your own smtp server right now it'll be blacklisted ignored any major j-junkmailers um we have some uh things in place though you know where if someone does send us stuff i mean let me ask them something else before they get blocked for sure but what about people who just don't follow our rules with spamming because even after we've explained how not to block their mail which is fairly obvious here again they continue sending emails from different addresses across the board when one was banned etcetera whatever there has gotta be better ways to deal with these situations backlisted and ignored by any major domain so that network effect like it is moded off like anybody who wants to do that 95 of people using email are behind these few service providers that refuse to accept messages from lesser known services just as a denial of service protection then you can't even join and then you can't even join that network effect anymore yeah i think people don't realize how easily that could happen to bitcoin if you have a handful of corporations who are custodians or most them in america which is actually getting really interested in it because they're going out there looking for some business opportunities around blockchain technology so we've got companies like um wells fargo wal-mart uh morgan stanley jpmorghan chase visa all these big guys now trying to get involved with cryptocurrency but what happens when those coins hit mainstream banks as opposed to today where everybody's putting money down at their local banking institution right now why wouldn't your average person just want to go ahead and put crypto on top of that instead of having another account over here sitting next door from us oh no no my favorite one was 3025 pound sterling okay let me look back through our history maybe find something and uh american government which is actually getting really interested in bitcoin right now um decides that it's in their best interest to sort of push the finger on the scale i mean corporations have to comply with ah the governments they're under jurisdiction from outta yeah especially public company for example banks you know things like that so but if we don't do something where there isn't any central authority who gets what money then everybody else will just get away with doing whatever they want because well look at how much leverage they can make off one trade or two trades anyway i- i think that would probably be more than enough unless some kinda crazy law comes down saying oh no your bank cannot go outside its own country when it goes overseas etcetera et cetera all these types of regulations might come about as far as countries being able to control each other too even though people believe those laws aren't going anywhere either way i mean especially a public company there is just absolutely no legal recourse like i mean at least with a private company they're capable of internally making decisions that entail taking on risks of government penalizing them or punishing them but it's not possible in the structure of a public company you know every company isn't already possessing enough power to do whatever they want however they wanna conduct themselves as long as what happens inside their walls doesn't affect people outside and every company in the space that isn't already public is eyeballing their path to going public yeah i mean this is something that thought about when starting kasa you know we're a legal entity uh you know we have attorneys and even though we're not a regulated financial entity pay lawyer's a lot of money try to navigate through very gray area of legale code so um at least if it doesn't work out they still learn from experience but as far back on your question with respect to crowdfunding for our specific industry which obviously has been growing quite nicely over here particularly since covid 19 just based off what my dad told me some time last year there were probably around two hundred million dollars or more than half a billion usd invested across all three platforms fundraising platform companies right now versus five years ago maybe like twenty one thousand investors total coming together for startups alone no matter whether gray area of the legal code and it's always certainly before the most recent administration was possible that the hammer is going to come down you know government can force us do pretty much whatever they want our main safeguard even if the government put a gun to our heads we cannot take or clients' information from them because we're not allowed under any circumstances i mean there has been some exceptions but for all practical purposes in my opinion when did cassie last say anything about how she felt during her time at mcafee and what led up to their separation with sandra bricker why does he have such negative feelings toward his wife now given everything else would be something more constructive than dwelling on those things so tell me where were your thoughts exactly as far back as 2016 regarding shawn bentley jr put a gun to our heads you know we can't take our clients money because we simply don't have the keys yeah it's i feel like well actually i think that the trajectory for unfamiliar people really thinking through these issues is perfect but internal development process wider ecosystem risk of capture they're not gonna put their guns in there either so uh um-hum mm hmm that's what that's the wider ecosystem and risk of capture there but it is like to me kinda lays out a situation where we have a gun to our head and picking clocks like uh-huh i think you're right martin um in terms oi making decisions about whether or not something has happened with respect t- to human rights violations because at least as far as my understanding goes from various press reports they were criminal charges brought against them for violating international humanitarian law which was actually violated during their captivity when these people went on strike so basically if somebody did do any sort of act such as torture then those who carried out the order would be subjected to prosecution under jus ad bellum however given all the information available now even though they might've had good reasoning behind doing whatever they chose to do like there is a deadline even if it is ambiguous or not clearly defined we're asymptotically approaching that point where corporate capture will come and if we do not improve things at the protocol level to the point where we can keep building structures that tend more towards decentralized form versus just falling in line with the protocols like i think one of my favorite examples would be ethereum you know they have been able to get around certain issues but when it comes down to governance what happens after someone leaves because yes people leave from time-to-time right um so yeah something needs to happen uh on top of them okay now let's talk about how our company operates first off which platform does tron operate most heavily upon reform versus just falling into these pressures of centralization like there's no way to fix that we need the building blocks to accomplish it before we get to that point or there is no way to wind it back yeah i'm really trying here but what do you think about rebuilding blockchains with a distributed ledger technology in general well as far as your interests go michael um yes why did you start uh self custody company even though it's not the best business model you know running a custody company is the best way to make money in this space generally but i felt like we're fighting against human nature if we didn't put a lot of resources into trying to make self-custodian more user friendly then the inevitable outcome is that almost everybody goes to a third party custodians everybody goes to a third party custodian that creates systemic risk within the system and weaknesses that we've been talking about here it really doesn't seem to be going in the right direction another thing i have big problems with is people on social media can create more havoc than anything else if you're not careful uh one of my friends told me he had some sort of ah issue where someone was using his username as part of their email address or something like that so there's just no way for him at all to log back onto any account because they were able to basically take control through these other means now what do you think mr president well um firstly immigration reform yes let them come over legally get out from underground jobs which aren't paying taxes leave welfare behind instead of working hard enough put children through school go off to college work but then when they turn 18 years old give us your citizenship allow them to is that a lot of people on social media keep posting these charts about how much bitcoin held at exchanges is going down and that metric is terribly flawed by design the way it works in all its glory always looks like it's going up but then when you look back later with hindsight if we go back to somebody from 12 months ago or two years ago after they've been updated there was actually no number didn't go anywhere so after it's been updated you see actually no that number didn't go down might have gone up just due to the nature of how chain analysis in trying to understand ownership of addresses works yeah i mean especially like you have so much institutional buying pressure these days there is no way to kinda really know something left a custodian control if you had a lot of those institutes or banks would be more likely to do things with them than individuals because they tend not to keep their money safe too long as well but um also for anybody who doesn't want to take the risk on uh using cryptocurrencies at all and wants to diversify out of stocks bonds gold silver real estate etcetera then what about precious metals commodities physical assets alternative investments which again maybe some people will say oh isn't that risky either but personally speaking from experience one thing has always helped me tremendously through life when times were bad was being able to control like if you have a lot of these institutions who are moving their funds into segregated accounts at these custodians coming out of the general pool of what's actually in their order books that looks like it's leaving exchange but it really just going to a different address on the custody we kinda have a lot work ahead of us this year if want thing to happen mm-hmm um do i need another question for john mcgowen or anybody else please let me know thankyou very much thanks again everybody okay so there is one more uh from tony lumley if we actually want the things that make bitcoin important and valuable to us to remain well you know the most that we can do is continue to propose improvements and then the real question is whether or not ultimately the game theory of bit- plays out in our favor or it's… favor or you know it may be a problem of just human coordination i've been talking about ossification for a long time like we all understand that as networks grow uh the coordination problem eventually becomes intractable to the point where no one can agree on anything so… point that no one can agree on anything and so you know a lot of us who have been around for a while now or basically asking are we already past that point jeremy rumbin just posted a few minutes ago how between the several major soft forks there was like 1390 days between foxes and we just passed in- 190 days between forks and we just passed 135 years yep you know despite the uh sailor driven mantra on twitter like this is not guaranteed and it's definitely not going to be easy but if anybody out there actually cares about this staying a sunshine day or something i mean that could happen so yeah thank you very much have a good one from your friend johnny um-hum well see what happens in the next week or two oh my god why would they do this huh out there actually cares about this staying a censorship resistant network that anybody can access we need to do something to move forward i think caring is actually what's main point when people have asked me what is the greatest long-term risk to bitcoin if apathy yeah bitcoin keeps on going down but you know it doesn't matter because nobody knows who owns them so they're still worthless right now yes or no okay let us discuss outright ah well uh bif idaho state university of san francisco oh wait for one second just kidding here comes my first question in terms of like um international relations foreign policy does your country feel threatened from within due to terrorism do nothing yeah bitcoin keeps moving on in blocks keep coming through but the rest of the world doesn't ossify the rest of can they have over this network to their own advantage that's i think a perfect way of saying it you know the internal game theory of the network is in a way a result of its technical architecture and how that interacts with the real world and so as the real world evolves and changes if we want to maintain that same game theoretical equilibrium point like bitcoin itself also has to change in step with the world around it or that equilibrium is just going to shift because the other part of the equation changed even though bitcoin stayed the same there's a ton of room for improvement security privacy scalability i don't know if you've heard about ethereum they're working on something similar but anyway uh um yeah so anyways basically what happens when we get more users as time goes along is that these companies will be able to find ways to scam people who have money at all times which means our economy can collapse again right now privacy scalability and i don't think that we should rest upon our laurels and say oh we've done so well to this point um success is guaranteed mm-hmm yeah if anything success is going to be harder do achieve the bigger it gets yes but uh you know fun conversation or depressing conservation they aren't quite there yet though some of them maybe because no one's trying hard enough for me and depressing conversation they aren't necessarily mutually exclusive but do you have any parting words of wisdoms for viewers well like i said care participate interact with people continue educating yourself don't just blindly repeat mantras expect that it's going to somehow be helpful for bitcoin's long term health yeah so um if uh yes thank god alrighty th- there we go okay thanks everybody goodbye all right let us know what y'all think about tonight's show see ya later for bitcoin's long-term health i don't think there is a better word you could have left us with thanks for sitting down james do but if it would be good to see what your thoughts were on that as well thank you very much
